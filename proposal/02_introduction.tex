\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Aim of Project}
I want to create an electronic musical instrument based on poi juggling. Basically, the movement of the pois while playing them should be interpreted into electronic sounds by self-programmed software. Ideally, the variance in movement should be audible in the generated sounds. 

\subsection{Scope}
The instrument should can be best played by artistic performers who can handle various poi choreographies. A laptop and my programmed software is needed to generate these sounds with the poi instrument. On stage, the generated sound output can be used as additional sound source to refine DJ sets or the instrument can serve as a stand-alone synthesizer.
